/**
 * @brief AI search technique for finding the best Action give a certain State
 *
 * The MCTS algorithm has four stages: selection, expansion, playout and backpropagation. This class represents the
 * general framework for executing these stages and uses a number of user-implemented classes which implement the game
 * rules.
 *
 * In the selection stage, MCTS uses the UCT formula to select the best node (or randomly if a node has not been
 * visited often enough, see MCTS::setMinVisits()) until it finds a node that still has nodes left to be expanded. The
 * UCT formula has one parameter, see MCTS::setC(). When PROG_HIST is defined, the progressive history heuristic is used
 * to influence the selection based on the success of an action during the playout stage. MCTS::setW() is used to set
 * the W parameter for progressive history.
 *
 * In the expansion stage an action is requested from the ExpansionStrategy and a node is expanded using that action.
 * When a node is not visited at least T times, expansion is skipped (see MCTS::setMinT()).
 *
 * In the playout stage, the PlayoutStrategy is used to generate moves until the end of the game is reached. When a
 * terminal state (the end of the game) is encoutered, the score is calculated using Scoring.
 *
 * In the backpropagation stage, Node::update() is called for each node from the node expanded in the expansion stage
 * to the root node. The score passed to Node::update() is the one from the call to Scoring::score() passed to
 * Backpropagation::updateScore() for each call to Node::update().
 *
 * The time that MCTS is allowed to search van be set by MCTS::setTime().
 *
 * @tparam T The State type this MCTS operates on
 * @tparam A The Action type this MCTS operates on
 * @tparam E The ExpansionStrategy this MCTS uses
