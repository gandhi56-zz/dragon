Instructions:
    Simply open index.html in your preferred browser
    To play hex, you just place a stone on any tile by clicking on it, but the colour of the stones alternate.
    The board is also represented in ascii format in the console which is shown whenever the board is altered.
    To upload a log file, simply upload or paste ONLY the moves to the text-area, then press upload. Similarly,to update the board size, just enter the new size in the field and press the resize button,

TODO:
    (1) introduce player vs. player
    (2) possibly score board and a record of plays

Issues:
	* Title: nexC or any other name you would like to call.
	* To preserve notation, the column labels should be lowercased.
	* We could make this a 'nex editor' type of tool that will allow
		editing the board and analyse positions. Of course,
		processing log files is still necessary.
	* Neutral stones
	* Allow rectangular boards as well (nexC allows it).
	* Time label to show the time taken to play a move.
